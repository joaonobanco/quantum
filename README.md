The current global digital communication infrastructure ensures individual and organizational privacy, information integrity, and internet authentication. The security of applications such as email, web browsers, and digital signatures relies on protocols[^1] of asymmetric[^2] cryptography, which are based on meticulously designed algorithms for ease of implementation and verification[^3], yet resilient against sophisticated attacks by classical computers or supercomputers.


[^1]: Highlighting common examples such as IP, SSL/TLS, SSH, MIME, PGP, and VPN

[^2]: Cryptographic systems utilize distinct and mathematically related key pairs, namely the public key and private key
  
[^3]: For instance, in the case of the RSA-2048 algorithm, deriving the public key from the private key is straightforward, but the reverse is unfeasible.
